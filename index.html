			<h1>Start young and build often.</h1>
			<p class="myPara">Some say it’s “never too late” to start, but at Camp K12 we believe it’s never too early. We chose to build our courses for KG – 12 students (hence the K12 in our name) rather than colleges because frankly, college is too late. Our goal is to work with impressionable young minds and to inculcate in them the healthy habits of problem solving and creativity. We want students in Indian schools to develop a sense of confidence in their abilities to create and an addiction to innovation — a muscle memory for building apps, movies, music, animations, graphics, and games.We feel that it is this early exposure and positive habits that will allow our campers in India to be the makers, doers, and entrepreneurs of tomorrow.</p>

			<h1>Don’t just play games — make them.</h1>
			<p class="myPara">We know you love technology. You listen to music, play games online and on your phones, and browse websites all day long. At Camp K12, we take your relationship with Technology to a whole new level by transforming you into a creator rather than a user of these things.Don’t just play games, make them. Don’t just listen to Avicci and Hardwell, make your own EDM. Make your own movies, animations, designs, and mobile apps, because you can, and because it’s fun to be able to turn your ideas into reality. Come build with us.</p>

			<h1>Learn by doing — our curriculum and approach</h1>
			<p class="myPara">Our curriculum was designed by our founder during his five years at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA) and has been implemented successfully in academic institutions across the world, including in Italy, Brazil, Kenya, China, and the United States. Campers complete multiple exciting projects right from day one, and work their way up to a Final Project which they showcase to their parents, teachers, and school principal on the final day of the camp.Our campers work on projects for causes and organizations they are passionate about or that solve real-world problems. Examples include Android Apps for the Disabled, Games to teach a new language to a child, Cards for a family member’s birthday or festival, TV advertisements about Android vs. iOS platforms, and Websites for their school clubs.</p>

		<p class="myPara">Our experience with Camp K12 has been a very positive one. They offer a unique blend of hands-on education and fun for the campers, and their bright and young instructors are able to connect with our students in ways that few others can. Through just a single 40 hour course, Camp K-12 shared with our students the exciting process of creative creation and transformed them into dedicated innovators.</p>

		<p class="myPara">Camp K12 ignited the minds of our students, creating in them eagerness to learn and the curiosity to try a variety of approaches. From creating an animation movie to designing one’s own website, students learnt effective ways to use the Internet with responsibility. There was a quantitative leap in the realization that far from being a mere medium of social interaction, the Internet and digitization were tools for the imagination and creativity.</p>

		<p class="myPara">The students who enrolled for Camp K12 have benefited immensely from the multimedia and Java programming. It is liberating to be able to design and execute an idea.
